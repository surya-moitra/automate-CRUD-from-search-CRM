# automate-CRUD-from-search-CRM
Deep Learning based solution to extrcat the intent from search queries in CRM and execute the relevant CRUD operations automatically.

CRUD operation Classification/Identification with ML
****************************************************

-> already built a ML model.

-> saved it.

-> the demo will show the Prediction part with the saved model.

->  the prediction script will be RESTified and deployed as a Service where:
        input  = search text
        output = (which)CRUD operation - 1/2/3/4

.

-> as we vary the i/p text - the o/p is different.
Now let us i/p some other category of buscomp which the Model has not seen during Training.

-> so, we observe that just like a human - the m/c is able to detect the correct CRUD operation and it is agnostic of the Category/BusComp.
